# Tutorials

Tutorials related to the pypomp project

### [Introduction to pypomp](https://pypomp.github.io/tutorials/intro/intro_to_pypomp.html)

This is a basic introduction for new users.

### [Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics using pypomp](https://pypomp.github.io/tutorials/sbied)

These SBIED  tutorials build on a previous [short course](https://github.com/kingaa/sbied) short course that presented the material using the R `pomp` package.

These notes are especially relevant for readers interested in `pypomp` for epidemiological or ecological applications.
However, the methodology is sufficiently general to be relevant to all those interested in inference for partially observed Markov process models in any application area.

### Notes

`pypomp` is in active development, and we are still experimenting with how to present material.
Please get in touch if you are reading this and you have feedback!
You are welcome to email [pypomp-org@umich.edu](mailto:pypomp-org@umich.edu), or you can communicate with the development team via [GitHub](https://github.com/pypomp).
