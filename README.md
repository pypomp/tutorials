## Tutorials related to the pypomp project

### [Introduction to the pypomp package for partially observed Markov process models](https://pypomp.github.io/tutorials/intro/intro_to_pypomp.html)

This is a basic introduction for new users.

### [Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics using pypomp](https://pypomp.github.io/tutorials/sbied)

This short course is especially relevant for readers interested in `pypomp` for epidemiological or ecological applications.
However, the methodology is sufficiently general to be relevant to all those interested in inference for partially observed Markov process models in any application area. The materials build on a previous [short course](https://github.com/kingaa/sbied) that presented the material using the R `pomp` package.

### Notes

1. Code documentation is available on the `pypomp` [Read the Docs page](https://pypomp.readthedocs.io).
2. Source code is available from the `pypomp` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pypomp/pypomp).
3. `pypomp` is [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pypomp/).
4. `pypomp` is in active development, and we are still experimenting with how to present material.
