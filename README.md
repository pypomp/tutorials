Tutorials related to the pypomp project

### [Introduction to pypomp](https://pypomp.github.io/tutorials/intro/intro_to_pypomp.html)

This is a basic introduction for new users.

### [Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics using pypomp](https://pypomp.github.io/tutorials/SBIED)

These tutorials involves adapting the previous [SBIED](https://github.com/kingaa/sbied) short course from R-pomp to `pypomp`. 
These notes are especially relevant for readers interested in `pypomp` for epidemiological or ecological applications, but the methodology is sufficiently general to be relevant to all those interested in inference for partially observed Markov process models in any application area.

### Notes

Pypomp is in early stages of development, so we are still experimenting with how to present material.
Please get in touch if you are reading this and you have feedback!
