# Introduction

This document provides instructions for setting up your computer to run the exercises in this course. We will be using **pypomp**, a Python implementation of partially observed Markov process (POMP) models.

## What you will need

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or conda package manager
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter)
- Basic familiarity with Python programming

# Python Installation

## Checking your Python version

First, check if you have Python installed and verify the version:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should have Python 3.8 or higher. If not, proceed to install Python.

## Installing Python

### Option 1: Using Anaconda (Recommended for beginners)

1. Download Anaconda from [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Anaconda includes Python and many scientific packages

### Option 2: Using official Python distribution

1. Download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation (Windows)

# Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

## Using venv (built-in)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv sbied-env

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source sbied-env/bin/activate

# On Windows:
sbied-env\Scripts\activate
```

## Using conda

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n sbied-env python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate sbied-env
```

# Installing Required Packages

## Installing pypomp

The main package we will use is **pypomp**. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pypomp
```

## Installing additional dependencies

Install the following packages that are commonly used in the course:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyter
```

If you are using conda, you can install these packages using:

```bash
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyter
```

## Optional: GPU acceleration with JAX

For faster computation, especially for large models, you can install JAX for GPU/TPU acceleration:

```bash
# For CPU-only (default)
pip install jax jaxlib

# For GPU support (CUDA)
# See https://github.com/google/jax#installation for detailed instructions
pip install jax[cuda12]
```

## Optional: Additional plotting libraries

For enhanced visualizations:

```bash
pip install seaborn plotly
```

# Setting Up Jupyter

Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive environment for running Python code.

## Installing Jupyter

If you haven't already installed Jupyter:

```bash
pip install jupyter notebook jupyterlab
```

## Launching Jupyter

To start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

To start JupyterLab (more modern interface):

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Registering your virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel

If you created a virtual environment, register it with Jupyter:

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=sbied-env --display-name="SBIED Course"
```

# Verifying Your Installation

## Test basic Python functionality

Create a test Python script or run in a Python interpreter:

```python
import sys
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")

import numpy as np
import scipy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

print("All basic packages imported successfully!")
```

## Test pypomp installation

Create a simple test to verify pypomp is working:

```python
import pypomp

print(f"pypomp version: {pypomp.__version__}")
print("pypomp installed successfully!")
```

## Test with a minimal example

Run this minimal POMP model to ensure everything is working:

```python
import numpy as np
import pypomp

# Create a simple random walk model
def step_fn(x, t, params, **kwargs):
    return {'X': x['X'] + np.random.normal(0, params['sigma'])}

def rinit_fn(params, **kwargs):
    return {'X': 0.0}

def rmeas_fn(x, t, params, **kwargs):
    return {'Y': x['X'] + np.random.normal(0, params['tau'])}

def dmeas_fn(y, x, t, params, log=True, **kwargs):
    ll = -0.5 * np.log(2 * np.pi * params['tau']**2) - \
         0.5 * (y['Y'] - x['X'])**2 / params['tau']**2
    return ll if log else np.exp(ll)

# Create POMP object
params = {'sigma': 1.0, 'tau': 0.1}
times = np.arange(0, 100)

# If this runs without error, your installation is working!
print("Test completed successfully!")
```

# Downloading Course Materials

## Using Git (recommended)

If you have Git installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[repository-url]/sbied-pypomp.git
cd sbied-pypomp
```

## Direct download

Alternatively, download the course materials as a ZIP file from the course website and extract them to your working directory.

# Troubleshooting

## Common issues and solutions

### "pip: command not found"

- Make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH
- Try using `python -m pip` instead of `pip`

### "Permission denied" errors

- On macOS/Linux, try using `pip install --user package_name`
- Or use a virtual environment (recommended)

### Import errors

- Make sure your virtual environment is activated
- Verify package installation: `pip list | grep package_name`
- Try reinstalling: `pip uninstall package_name && pip install package_name`

### Jupyter kernel issues

- Make sure ipykernel is installed in your environment
- Re-register the kernel (see "Registering your virtual environment" above)
- Restart Jupyter after adding a new kernel

## Getting help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the pypomp documentation: [https://github.com/pypomp/pypomp](https://github.com/pypomp/pypomp)
2. Search for error messages online
3. Ask for help during the course sessions
4. Check the course discussion forum

# Summary

By now, you should have:

- ✓ Python 3.8+ installed
- ✓ A virtual environment created and activated
- ✓ pypomp and required packages installed
- ✓ Jupyter set up (if using notebooks)
- ✓ Verified your installation with test code

You are now ready to begin the course!
