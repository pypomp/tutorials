inference for epidemiological dynamics with pypomp</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This short course introduces statistical inference techniques and
computational methods for dynamic models of epidemiological systems. The
course explores deterministic and stochastic formulations of
epidemiological dynamics and develop inference methods appropriate for a
range of models. Special emphasis will be on exact and approximate
likelihood as the key elements in parameter estimation, hypothesis
testing, and model selection. Specifically, the course emphasizes
sequential Monte Carlo techniques.</p>
<p>This is an adaptation of the previous <a
href="https://github.com/kingaa/sbied">SBIED</a> short course from
<strong>R-pomp</strong> to <strong>pypomp</strong>. As such, its
objectives are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To introduce partially observed Markov process (POMP) models as
tools for scientific investigation and public health policy.</li>
<li>To give students the ability to formulate POMP models of their
own.</li>
<li>To teach efficient approaches for performing scientific inference
using POMP models.</li>
<li>To familiarize students with the <strong>pypomp</strong>
package.</li>
<li>To help students familiar with the <strong>R-pomp</strong> package
to transfer that expertise to <strong>pypomp</strong>.</li>
<li>To give students opportunities to work with inference methods,
including methodologies that use automatic differentiation and GPUs
which are not accessible via <strong>pomp</strong>.</li>
<li>To provide documented examples for student re-use.</li>
